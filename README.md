# About Me
I have spent the last twenty years teaching Chemistry and Computer Science and am now looking to change careers. Coding has been a hobby of mine and I want to do it professionally.

## Current Stuff
I am a student at Code Institute getting a qualification as a Full Stack Developer. I am loving every minute of it - even those minutes when I want to slam my laptop screen down in frustration.

### Current Project(s)
I am currently working on my capstone project for Code Institute using React as a front end and Django REST Api as the backend. The site will offer those who love food as much as I do a chance to browse through and share their favorite recipes.

### Past Projects
+ A website in pure HTML and CSS to help IB Computer Science students master the Paper 3 exam.
+ A Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! game in JavaScript and HTML
+ A thermodynamic calculator written in Python that allows you to query a dataset to calculate the enthalpy, free energy, and entropy change for chemical reaction.
+ A book blogging site using Django for readers to see and comment upon what other book lovers are reading.

## Other Tech
I love anything having to do with coding and some of the other technologies I enjoy working with are:
+ Android - I love Android and will get back to writing Android apps as soon as I can.
+ Flutter - What a cool framework. One codebase for Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and web - what more could you want?
+ Python - The language that can do almost anything. Anyone who loves science and coding as much as I do just loves Python. It is the language for data analysis.


## Other than coding ...
I love my computer. I really do. However, when I am not sitting in front of it I like spending my time doing things that enrich my life.

+ Reading - Science and math top the list but when I am in the mood for fiction (which is a lot), I love mysteries and historical fiction.
+ Cooking - My parents were Italian immigrants and you better believe food was (and is) an important part of my life. Nothing makes me happier than spending some time in front of the stove preparing something tasty.
+ The three Bs - Bach, Beethoven, Brahms - Studying their music is an endless source of satisfaction
